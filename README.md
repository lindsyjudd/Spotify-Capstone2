Start to finish project creation: identify, clean, improve structure and quality of dataset, create outline/ hypothesis, define and own metrics for business related objective, undertake advanced analytics research, distill and communicate finding with high quality data visualizations. 
Tools used: Power Point Presentation, Python, Power BI, and Excel to analyze and visualize the data. 
I also conducted interviews on the subject matter. 
I identified statistically significant patterns, correlations, and compiled questions raised by analysis.

This is the python exploration of the project.
